# Artificial Intelligence Website
This is the website I created for the Independent Study assignment. This website was made with a parralax effect. Keep scrolling and enjoy! Download instructions are below.

# Downloading the Website's Contents
The first step is to download the website. Click the green "Clone or download" button, and download the ZIP. 

# Extracting the Contents and Wiewing the Site
The next step is to extract the contents of the folder. After this is done, navigate to the folder with the uncompressed files (the non-ZIP folder) and open it up. Open the "AI_and_Robotics_main.htm file. Enjoy!
